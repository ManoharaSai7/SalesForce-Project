## Project Overview

The Garage Management System (GMS) is designed to manage customer interactions, vehicle appointments, service records, billing, and feedback. Built using Salesforce, this system provides a centralized database to store and manage data, making garage operations more efficient. GMS covers the complete service process, from customer appointments to post-service feedback, improving service quality and operational efficiency.

## Project Architecture

The GMS follows a multi-layered architecture on the Salesforce platform:

1. **Data Layer**: Holds custom Salesforce objects—Customer Details, Appointment, Service Records, Billing Details, and Feedback—along with any standard objects for data integrity.
2. **Logic Layer**: Comprises Apex classes, flows, and triggers that execute business logic, automating tasks like notifying customers, updating service status, and generating invoices.
3. **UI Layer**: Built with Lightning Web Components (LWC), creating an intuitive interface for users to view and manage garage operations.

The architecture is designed for scalability, allowing easy addition of new features without compromising performance.
